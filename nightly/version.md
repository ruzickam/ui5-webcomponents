    feat(framework): switch default theme from Quartz Light to Morning Hoâ€¦ (#7749)
    
    Until now, Quartz Light ("sap_fiori_3") used to be the default theme for our framework.
    However, as Morning Horizon has been around for almost two years and the majority of our consumers migrated to Horizon, we now switch our default theme from Quartz Light to Morning Horizon ("sap_horizon").
