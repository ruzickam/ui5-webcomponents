    revert(ui5-color-palette-item): revert selected state feature (#7782)
    
    Due to lack of clear guidelines around the interaction, we currently decided to not move forward with the selected state feature in our ColorPalette's components, and revert the current implementation, until a finalized guidelines are provided in order avoid unwanted and inconsistent interaction behaviour.
